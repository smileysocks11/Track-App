Mr. Espinosa has asked you to write an application that meets the following design requirements:


The program should read student athletes from a .txt file.


Output the total number of student athletes and prompt for the number of event flights.


Sort the athletes, ascending, by their max distance thrown.


Confirm no athletes need to be added.  Add and re-sort if necessary.


The program should build a 3D array, distributing the athletes across the user inputted # of flights, with the latest flights having the remainder of any uneven distribution of students


The program should prompt for a flight to begin throwing.


Output the first athlete’s name in the format: last name, firstname and prompt to throw, or skip.


If the user chooses to skip, select the next athlete and prompt again.


Once the user selects to throw, take inputs for their throw in feet, inches, and 1\4 inches.


Select the first available thrower, repeat the above process.


Once all throwers have made all 3 throws, sort the throwers by furthest distance thrown and output to the screen and to a file.


Drive the program with text menus: (Example ideas)


1. Enter athletes
2. View all athletes
3. View current throw status
4. View current leaderboard
5. Throw
