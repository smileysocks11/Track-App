You will write this program as a team!

-One student will design the function main, which will call all other functions in the program.  The remainder of the functions will be designed by other members of the team.
-The requirements of the program should be analyzed as a team and split up so each student is given about the same workload.
-The parameters of each function and its return values should be decided ahead of time.
-Stubs/Drivers should be used to test and debug the program.
-The program should be implemented and shared using github. (The person writing main should create a public repository and share it with all other members of the team)  -The program can be written as a multi-file project, or a single-file project.

Here is the assignment:  Mr. Espinosa has asked you to write an application that meets the following design requirements:

-The program should read student athletes from a .txt file.
-Output the total number of student athletes and prompt for the number of event flights.
-Sort the athletes, ascending, by their max distance thrown.
-Confirm no athletes need to be added.  Add the new athlete and re-sort if necessary.
-The program should build a 3D array, distributing the athletes across the user inputted # of flights, with the latest flights having the remainder of any uneven distribution of students
-The program should prompt for a flight to begin throwing.
-Output the first athleteâ€™s name in the format: last name, firstname and prompt to throw, or skip.
-If the user chooses to skip, select the next athlete and prompt again.
-Once the user selects to throw, take inputs for their throw in feet, inches, and 1\4 inches.
-Select the first available thrower, repeat the above process.
-Once all throwers have made all 3 throws, sort the throwers descending by distance thrown and output to the screen and to a file.
-The program should run the current meet until the user quits

Part 2 will be to work as a team to understand how and develop a GUI for a windows and android based application.

Drive the program with text menus: (Examples)

1. Enter additional athletes
2. View previous meets
3. View all athletes
4. View current throw status
5. View current leaderboard
6. Throw
0. Quit
